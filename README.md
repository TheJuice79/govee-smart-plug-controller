# Govee Controller

A Python script and Docker container that automatically controls a Govee smart plug based on weather conditions such as temperature and cloud cover. Ideal for automating pool heaters, fans, or other devices depending on outdoor conditions.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Pulls current weather from the Open-Meteo API
- Turns Govee smart plug ON or OFF using configurable thresholds
- Runs on a schedule with graceful shutdown handling
- Deployable via Docker or Docker Compose
- Pushes to GitHub Container Registry for easy Portainer or cloud deployment
- Logs with time zone awareness

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheJuice79/govee-smart-plug-controller.git
cd govee-smart-plug-controller
```

### 2. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your configuration:

```env
GOVEE_API_KEY=your_govee_api_key
DEVICE_MAC=your_device_mac
DEVICE_MODEL=your_device_model
LAT=39.8333
LON=-98.5855
START_TIME=00:00
END_TIME=23:59
TEMP_UNIT=fahrenheit
TEMP_THRESHOLD=75
CLOUD_THRESHOLD=50
CHECK_INTERVAL=15
TZ=America/Chicago
```

---

## üê≥ Using Docker

### Build Locally

```bash
docker build -t govee-controller .
```

### Run

```bash
# From GitHub Container Registry
docker run --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped --name govee-controller ghcr.io/thejuice79/govee-smart-plug-controller:latest

# Or from Docker Hub
docker run --env-file .env --restart unless-stopped --name govee-controller thejuice79/govee-smart-plug-controller:latest
```

---

## üß± Using Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  govee-controller:
    container_name: govee-controller
    image: ghcr.io/thejuice79/govee-smart-plug-controller:latest
    environment:
      - GOVEE_API_KEY=your_govee_api_key
      - DEVICE_MAC=your_device_mac
      - DEVICE_MODEL=your_device_model
      - LAT=39.8333
      - LON=-98.5855
      - START_TIME=00:00
      - END_TIME=23:59
      - TEMP_UNIT=fahrenheit
      - TEMP_THRESHOLD=75
      - CLOUD_THRESHOLD=50
      - CHECK_INTERVAL=15
      - TZ=America/Chicago
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then start with:

```bash
docker compose up -d

## How to Get Your Govee API Key

To control your Govee smart devices programmatically, you need to obtain an API key from Govee. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Govee Developer Account**  
   - Visit the [Govee Developer Portal](https://developer.govee.com/).  
   - Click **Sign Up** and create a new account using your email address.

2. **Verify Your Email**  
   - Check your email inbox for a verification message from Govee.  
   - Follow the link in the email to verify your account.

3. **Log in to the Developer Portal**  
   - After verification, log in at [https://developer.govee.com/](https://developer.govee.com/).

4. **Create a New API Key**  
   - Navigate to the **API Keys** section in your dashboard.  
   - Click **Create API Key**.  
   - Provide a name/label for your key (e.g., "Govee Controller Script").  
   - Agree to the terms and generate the key.

5. **Copy Your API Key**  
   - Copy the generated API key to your clipboard.  
   - Keep this key safe and **do not share it publicly**.

6. **Add the API Key to Your `.env` File**  
   - Open your `.env` file in the project directory.  
   - Set the `GOVEE_API_KEY` variable to your copied API key, like this:  
     ```env
     GOVEE_API_KEY=your_actual_govee_api_key_here
     ```

## How to Find Your Govee Device MAC Address and Model Number

You need the **MAC address** and **model number** of your Govee smart plug to configure the controller correctly. Here's how to find them:

### Option 1: Using the Govee Home App

1. Open the **Govee Home** app on your smartphone.
2. Navigate to your smart plug device in the device list.
3. Tap on the device to open its settings.
4. Scroll down to find **Device Information** or **About**.
5. Look for the **MAC Address** and **Model Number** listed there.
6. Note these values exactly as shown (usually MAC looks like `A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6`).

### Option 2: Using the Govee API (Requires API Key)

You can list your devices with the Govee API to get their MAC and model info:

```bash
curl -H "Govee-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" https://developer-api.govee.com/v1/devices
```

This returns JSON with your registered devices and their details, including `device` (MAC) and `model`.
